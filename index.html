                        <p>The heatmap viz depicts the density of crowdsourced data throughout a given day for a particular utility. It allows you to select a day from the list of days and a utility from the list of utilities. A slider enables selection
                            of color intensity of the heatmap. Based on the chosen parameters, the rendered viz will show the number of data points recorded for the selected utility at the selected location. A tooltip shows the exact count of people who
                            have reported the data for the chosen parameters. <br> <br>

                        <p>The box plot is a static visualization showing average intensity of reported damage. Using the information of three quartile ranges depicted by the box plot, one can determine where 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the crowdsourced
                            data lie. Based on the average intensities observed, one can conclude which neighborhood is the hardest hit one and hence requires immediate attention. <br> <br>

                        <p> The scatter plot helps in determining the reliability of reports for various neighborhoods. To interact with the plot, select a location, a day and a utility using the three dropdown lists provided. This will render a distribution
                            of crowdsourced data regarding the damage caused to the selected utility on the selected day and at the selected location. The rendered plot will show whether the reported data for the selected parameters is clustered or scattered.
                            If data is clustered, it means many people have reported the same damage intensity while scattered data means different people have reported different intensity of damage caused to that utility on that day at that location.

                        <p>For interaction, select a location from the list of location, a utility from the checkboxes and time from a time-slider provided at the bottom of the chart. This will show a line chart displaying how the crowdsourced data for the
                            selected utility and at the selected location changes over time. It can also compare the intensity of damage caused to different utilities at the chosen location and at the selected time. The discontinuity of the chart is because
                            some of the reported data is missing in the database. Based on the damage intensity observed, one can prioritize the neighborhoods to decide which location needs more resources at a given time.<br> <br>

                            get the counts of missing and reported data and comparing their proportions, one can determine how uncertain the crowdsourced data is. <br> <br>
